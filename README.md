# Withward Frontend Application
Withward is the combination of the word "with" and the native English suffix "-ward", which is defined as denoting spatial or temporal direction, as specified by the initial element, such as toward; seaward; afterward; and backward.

For thousands of years, humans have traveled together to survive. If you are familiar with The Legend of Zelda, you may have come to know the quote, "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this." This quote appears when Link is given a sword from the unnamed old man inside of the first cave of the game. This sword becomes instrumental in his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue princess Zelda. So, how does this help me understand withward? I'm glad you asked...

The idea of withward means to travel with someone toward any destination. The withward app will help you stay organized in your real life quests by connecting you with other users, keeping track of your visited and to-be-visited destinations, and allow you and your companions to contribute their ratings to a visited place.

## Feature Walkthrough

1. A user may begin by clicking Register New Account to be taken to the Register Account page.
Upon completion, they will be logged in and presented with their Profile name and password.

2. Next, click Logout on the top navbar, which will log the user out.

3. Then re-enter your new password and username to log back in.

4. Now as a non-administrative user, you have access to Updating your password by clicking [Update Password] on your profile screen.

5. The form prompts you to confirm your password, and only accepts the new password if it matches the confirm password text, once complete you are returned to your Profile page.

6. Next, log out again and begin logging in as the user known as "user2" with a password of "1111". 

7. Now, as the user user2, you may look at your list of Withlists by selecting the Withlist navbar option.

8. Here you will see your current list of Withlists.

9. Next logout and begin logging in as an administrator. One such admin account is called "admin" with a creative password of "admin".

10. When logging in as an Admin, ensure you check the Admin checkbox to ensure you are routed through the administrative login.

11. Once finished, you now have administrative access to the Admin navbar option, however if it has not appeared, simply refresh the page and it should appear.
This is due to a minor bug that will be fixed with MVP 2.0.

12. After clicking Admin, you are taken to a list of all User details.

13. When finished, please remember to logout and have a good day.
