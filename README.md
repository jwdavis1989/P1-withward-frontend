#Withward Frontend Application
withward is the combination of the word "with" and the native English suffix "-ward", which is defined as denoting spatial or temporal direction, as specified by the initial element, such as toward; seaward; afterward; and backward.

For thousands of years, humans have traveled together to survive. If you are familiar with The Legend of Zelda, you may have come to know the quote, "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this." This quote appears when Link is given a sword from the unnamed old man inside of the first cave of the game. This sword becomes instrumental in his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue princess Zelda. So, how does this help me understand withward? I'm glad you asked...

The idea of withward means to travel with someone toward any destination. The withward app will help you stay organized in your real life quests by connecting you with other users, keeping track of your visited and to-be-visited destinations, and allow you and your companions to contribute their ratings to a visited place.
